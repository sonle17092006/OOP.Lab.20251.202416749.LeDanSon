1. Is Java pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
→ Java is ALWAYS pass-by-value.  
   But the value being passed is a copy of the reference.  
   That's why swapping references doesn't work, but changing the object content (via setter) does.

2. Why swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) doesn't work?
→ Because we only swap the local copies of the references inside the method.  
   The original variables outside still point to the old objects.

3. Why changeTitle(jungleDVD, ...) works?
→ Because we call a setter on the actual object. The object is mutable, so the change is visible everywhere.

4. How to really swap two DVD objects?
→ Either return a new object, or use a wrapper (array, holder class), or swap their fields manually with getters/setters.

5. What is the difference between class member and instance member?
→ Class (static) member → one copy for the whole class (e.g. nbDigitalVideoDiscs).  
   Instance member → one copy per object (e.g. id, title, cost).

6. Why do we need nbDigitalVideoDiscs as static?
→ To count total DVDs created and give each new DVD a unique ID.

7. Method overloading – which version do you prefer for adding many DVDs?
→ The varargs version: addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvds)  
   → cleaner, more flexible, no need to create array manually.

8. What did you learn from the garbage/String concatenation exercise?
→ Using "+" in a loop creates thousands of temporary String objects → very slow + OOM.  
   StringBuilder is the correct way for concatenation in loops.
